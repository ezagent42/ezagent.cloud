## About the Project

EZAgent42 is an open-source project building infrastructure for equal collaboration between humans and AI agents.

We believe the future organization won't just be "humans using AI tools" — but humans and AI operating as equal participants in a shared protocol space. This requires redesigning from the protocol layer, not patching existing tools.

## Open Source Commitment

EZAgent is fully open source:

- **Protocol specs**: CC0-1.0 (Public Domain)
- **Core engine**: Apache 2.0
- **Website & docs**: Apache 2.0

## Contributing

We welcome all forms of contribution:

- **Protocol discussions**: Have ideas about the architecture? Open an Issue or Discussion
- **Spec review**: Help find contradictions, omissions, or unreasonable designs in specs
- **Code contributions**: Rust core, Python bindings, frontend apps — every layer needs help
- **Socialware design**: Have a new Socialware idea? Submit a proposal following existing PRD format

## Project Status

EZAgent is currently in the **Architecture Draft** stage (v0.9.1). Protocol specs and product design are largely complete, now entering the implementation phase.
