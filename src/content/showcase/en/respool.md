ResPool is EZAgent's **resource pool manager** — a platform-level infrastructure Socialware.

It manages shared organizational resources with protocol-native allocation, tracking, and settlement. From GPU-hours to budgets to API quotas — all resources become programmable.

### Core Capabilities

- **Fair allocation**: Role-based resource quotas with dynamic adjustment
- **Usage tracking**: Real-time resource consumption monitoring via CRDT
- **Automated settlement**: Task completion triggers automatic resource settlement
- **Cross-Socialware integration**: Works with TaskArena for task-based billing
