AgentForge is EZAgent's **agent lifecycle manager** — a platform-level infrastructure Socialware.

It manages the full lifecycle of AI agents within an organization: registration, capability declaration, health monitoring, and orchestration. Agents become first-class organizational citizens with clear capabilities and accountability.

### Core Capabilities

- **Agent registry**: Declare agent capabilities and constraints at registration
- **Health monitoring**: Track agent availability, performance, and error rates
- **Capability matching**: Route tasks to agents based on declared capabilities
- **Graceful degradation**: Automatic failover when agents become unavailable
